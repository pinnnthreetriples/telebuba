"""Pydantic schemas for the neurocomment domain (issue #114).

Data contracts flowing between ``core.repositories.neurocomment`` (persistence),
the future ``services/neurocomment/`` (business logic) and features (UI). No
behaviour, no I/O — non-negotiable #2. Style mirrors ``schemas/warming.py``.

Campaign lifecycle (``CampaignStatus``):
- ``active``   — running; its channels hold the "one active campaign" slot.
- ``paused``   — temporarily off; channels freed (links deactivated).
- ``archived`` — retired.

Comment lifecycle (``CommentStatus``):
- ``claimed`` — a fleet account won the ``(channel, post_id)`` claim, not yet posted.
- ``posted``  — comment delivered (``comment_msg_id`` set).
- ``failed``  — delivery failed after retries.
