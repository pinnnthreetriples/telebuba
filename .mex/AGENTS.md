# Telebuba

## What This Is
Telegram account farm manager: creates accounts, warms them up with human-like activity, and generates AI comments.

## Stack
Python 3.13 · NiceGUI · SQLAlchemy/SQLite · Telethon · APScheduler · httpx · loguru+structlog+Sentry · uv · ruff · ty · pytest

## File Map

## Non-Negotiables (one line each — full text in `context/conventions.md`)
1. Feature isolation — one feature per file in `features/`; never modify existing feature files.
2. No cross-feature imports — `features/a.py` must not import `features/b.py`.
3. Pydantic at every layer boundary — no raw `dict`/`tuple`/`list` crossing layers.
4. No hardcoded values — tunables in `core/config.py`, secrets in `.env`.
5. No `print()` — `core/logging.py` only.
6. Layer isolation — see import matrix in `context/architecture.md`.
7. Gateways — DB only via `core/db.py`; Telegram only via `core/telegram_client.py`.
8. Test coverage — every new feature ships with a `tests/test_*.py`.
9. Async + type safety — type hints on every function; `from __future__ import annotations`; I/O is `async def`; `raise X(...) from e`.
10. Device fingerprint immutable — one profile per account, created once, never mutated.
11. Configuration-driven — no magic numbers; all tunables in `core/config.py`.

## Commands
- Install: `uv sync`
- Dev: `uv run python main.py`
- Test: `uv run pytest`
- Lint / format: `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .`
- Types: `uv run ty check .`
- Pre-commit (all hooks): `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
- Full toolchain — see `context/setup.md`.

## Scaffold Growth
After meaningful work, run GROW:
- **Ground:** what changed in reality?
- **Record:** update `ROUTER.md`'s pointer to `state/active.md`; update relevant `context/` files.
- **Orient:** create or update a `patterns/` runbook if this can recur.
- **Write:** bump `last_updated` on changed files; `mex log` when rationale matters.

## Default Skills (apply silently — do not announce or re-invoke each turn)

These are global skills the user has set as defaults. Every session applies them without being asked.

- **`karpathy-guidelines`** — coding behaviour: surface assumptions, prefer the minimum code, surgical changes only, transform tasks into verifiable goals. Applies to every write/review/refactor action.
- **`caveman`** — communication style: drop filler, articles, pleasantries; keep code, commands, errors, technical terms exact. Default to brief. Expand only when clarity, safety, or the user explicitly asks for detail.

Other skills (`handoff`, `verify`, `code-review`, etc.) are triggered on demand — see `~/.claude/skills/` for the full installed set.

## Navigation
Read `ROUTER.md` at session start before any task. Live project state lives in `state/active.md`. Work is picked from the GitHub Project board — protocol in `context/kanban.md` (load this every session too).
