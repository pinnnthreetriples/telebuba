# CI Policy

Workflows live under `.github/workflows/`. Two files:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fires on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`.
- `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` — fires on `cron: "0 3 * * *"` UTC and `workflow_dispatch`.

Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly PRs for GitHub Actions updates.

## What runs when

| Job | PR | Push to main | Nightly | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` (pre-commit all hooks) | ✓ | ✓ | — | ruff + ruff-format + bandit + ty + gitleaks + hygiene + deptry + vulture + radon (cc D+ gate) |
| `test` (pytest strict) | ✓ | ✓ | extended profile only | Hypothesis: `dev` (50) on PR, `strict` (200) on main, `extended` (2000) nightly |
| `audit` (pip-audit) | ✓ | ✓ | — | CVEs in deps |
| `semgrep` (auto config) | ✓ | ✓ | — | runs on PR + push so the security gate is pre-merge |
| `aislop` (quality gate) | ✓ | ✓ | — | zero-tolerance: any error OR warning fails; needs Node (npx) |
| `semgrep-full` (3 rulesets) | — | — | ✓ | security-audit + OWASP top 10 + python |
| `extended-hypothesis` | — | — | ✓ | 2000 examples per property |
| `frontend` (lint/boundaries/tsc/vitest) | ✓ | ✓ | — | ESLint + Prettier + Steiger boundary-lint + `tsc --strict` + Vitest (≥ 80%) over `frontend/` |
| `frontend-e2e` (Playwright smoke) | ✓ | ✓ | — | critical flows (login, each screen loads, one happy-path action) |
| `gen-api-drift` | ✓ | ✓ | — | regenerate the hey-api client from the backend OpenAPI; fail if it differs from the committed client |

Frontend jobs run on changes under `frontend/` (and `gen-api-drift` whenever the API surface
or the generated client changes). The Python and frontend job sets are independent — a backend
change need not run Playwright, and vice versa.

## Quality gates (deptry / vulture / radon / aislop)

All four were installed but unwired; they now gate:

- **deptry** — unused / missing / transitive deps. Pre-commit + lint job. Two
  documented `per_rule_ignores` in `pyproject.toml`: `opentele2` (DEP002, lazy
  `importlib` import) and `hypothesis` (DEP004, dev dep used in `conftest.py`).
  `tools/` is excluded (it imports the dev-only `radon`).
- **vulture** — dead code. Pre-commit + lint job. Scans `api/`, `core/`, `schemas/`, `services/` (config in `pyproject.toml`). Re-exports stay live via each package's
  `__all__`.
- **radon** — cyclomatic complexity. radon never exits non-zero on its own, so
  `tools/radon_gate.py` wraps its API and **fails on rank D+ (cc > 20)**. Chosen
  over the stricter C+ so genuinely-overgrown functions are caught without
  forcing artificial splits of branchy domain logic.
- **aislop** — AI-slop quality gate (an npm tool via `npx`, so it needs Node).
  `tools/aislop_gate.py` parses its JSON and is **zero-tolerance: any error OR
  warning fails**. Dedicated CI job (`setup-node`) + a `pre-push` pre-commit hook
  (heavy, so not every commit). Its size rules (`file-too-large` 400,
  `function-too-long` 80, `too-many-params` 6) and `repetitive-dispatch` drove
  the package splits across `core`/`services`/`api`. The `frontend/` React SPA
  is excluded from aislop (it has its own gate set: eslint/tsc/vitest).

`tools/` helpers are excluded from deptry/bandit (`exclude_dirs`/hook `exclude`)
and semgrep (`.semgrepignore`), with a narrow ruff ignore for the intentional
subprocess.

## Triggers and skips

- **`paths-ignore`** on both PR and push: `.mex/`, `**.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`. Doc-only commits do not start CI.
- **`workflow_dispatch`** on both `ci` and `nightly` — re-runnable from the GitHub UI.
- **`concurrency` cancel-in-progress** — a new push cancels the previous run on the same branch.

## Strictness inheritance

CI does not redefine strictness; it inherits from `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options]`. Whatever fails locally fails in CI. Conversely, if CI passes and local fails, the diff is in environment, not config.

`HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE` is set per job:
- PR job → `dev` (50 examples, fast feedback)
- main push → `strict` (200 examples)
- nightly → `extended` (2000 examples)

Selection lives in `conftest.py`.

## Caches

- `setup-uv@v6` with `enable-cache: true` — uv caches `.venv` and the package cache per workflow.
- The `actions-cache` GitHub Action (v4) keyed on `hashFiles('.pre-commit-config.yaml')` — pre-commit hook envs persist between runs (saves 30–40 s per lint job).

## Override / override-dependencies policy

`pyproject.toml [tool.uv].override-dependencies` is the only place we pin past upstream constraints (e.g. CVE-driven bumps). Every entry MUST carry a comment naming the advisory IDs and the upstream chain that pins the bad version. Reviewed on every `semgrep` / `pip-audit` failure.

## What does NOT belong in CI

- `pytest-xdist` parallelism — add only when test count justifies it; with the canary alone it is noise.
- `mutmut` — gated to nightly + `workflow_dispatch` once it has real code to mutate. See `state/active.md` (Open Decisions section).
- Branch protection / required-status-check setup — that lives in repo settings, not workflows.

## Coverage source

Backend branch coverage (`--cov-fail-under=90`) measures `api`, `core`, `schemas`, `services`
(the deleted `features/` layer is gone; `api/` replaces it as the UI-thin coverage target).
Frontend coverage is a separate Vitest floor (≥ 80%) reported by the `frontend` job — see
`context/frontend.md`.

## gen-api drift check

The TS client under `frontend/src/shared/api` is generated from the backend OpenAPI by
`@hey-api/openapi-ts` (script in slice #165). CI regenerates it and fails if the result differs
from what is committed, so the wire contract and the client never silently diverge. Regenerate
locally and commit the result whenever the API surface changes.
