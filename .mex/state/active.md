# Active State

This file is a **snapshot, not a changelog** — history lives in git / merged PRs / `.mex/events/`. Keep it short; compacted 2026-07-06.

## Current State

**Feature-complete and stable on `main`** (as of 2026-07-06, HEAD ≈ PR #199). The React SPA + FastAPI `/api/v1` split stack, the pixel-perfect design port, full backend wiring, warming personas, neurocomment Ф1+Ф2 with the vision captcha solver, the 2026-07-02 audit remediation (#197), and nightly/CI hardening (#199) are all merged. CI (7 jobs) and the nightly (mutation ~72.7% kill / semgrep-full / hypothesis-extended) are green. Current work = bug fixes and small operator-driven improvements.

## Not Yet Built (deliberate)

- **#149 HITL captcha canary** — operator-run; never an agent task.
- PM-delivered captchas (Rose non-button modes) not watched; grid/slider/jigsaw give up by design.
- Proxy unassign-from-account: backend exists (`POST /proxies/unassign`), no UI trigger.
- `ListenerEditModal` persists the picked listener only while the runtime runs.
- Accounts table status filter / column sort / bulk actions — backend supports, UI gap.
- Photo «сделать главной» — no set-existing-as-main RPC in the gateway.
- Warming per-action numeric limits stay auto/config (read-only in UI, auto-cap ADR).

## Known Issues

- aislop gate = `uv run python tools/aislop_gate.py`; `python -m aislop` does not work (npm tool).
- Local `prettier --check .` floods with CRLF false positives (LF in git, CI green) — check only changed files after `prettier --write`.

## Open Decisions

- **Account lifecycle enum beyond session health** — `accounts.status` (session health) vs `warming_account_state.state` (runtime lifecycle); a unified business lifecycle is undecided. (`context/telegram.md`)
- **Project purpose / "why"** — deliberately deferred; not documented anywhere.
